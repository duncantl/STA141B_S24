# Dates, Locales, functions and on.exit()

Recall in assignment 1, we were reading dates of the form
`16-Oct-1996`.

We can convert this to a Date object with `as.Date()`, i.e.,
```
eg = "16-Oct-1196"
as.Date(eg, "%d-%b-%Y")
```
The `%b` means "abbreviated name of the month". `as.Date()` uses this to recognize the Oct value in
the string.

Some of you may have written this exact code and yet got `NA` as the result.
The most likely reason is that your version of R (and your computer) are using a different
**locale** which controls the "internationalization services".  The locale controls, amongst other aspects,

+ the ordering for characters and so how strings are sorted,
+ how (non-monetary) numbers are represented, e.g., with . or , 
+ how dates and times

Suppose I am using a German locale, e.g., `de_DE`.
Then `%b` will look for values from 
 Jan, Feb, MÃ¤r, Apr, Mai, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Okt, Nov, Dez
since these are the German abbreviated month names.
(We found these via the command
```
m = seq(as.Date("2024/1/1"), length = 12, by = "month")
# or 
m = as.Date(sprintf("1-%d-2024", 1:12), "%d-%m-%Y")
format(m, "%b")
```
)
Since Oct is not one of these, `as.Date()` cannot make sense of our example string and returns `NA`.


Similarly, if my computer defaults to an "English" locale, e.g., en_US, how do I read a date of the
form "janvier/9/2024" which uses the full French month name.

In other words, if I have date that use one language and my locale is for a different language, how
do I get R to read the date using the appropriate locale for that specific string/date.

One way is to set your locale to the target language, e.g., French in the case above for `janvier` or
English in the original example of `Oct`.
We can do this with
```{r}
Sys.setlocale(locale = "fr_CA")
as.Date("janvier/9/2024", "%B/%d/%Y")
```
```{r}
Sys.setlocale(locale = "en_US")
as.Date(eg, "%d-%b-%Y")
```

However, we are not using that locale we set.
We really should reset it back to the original value after we call `as.Date()`.
We can query the current locale and then arrange to reset the locale to that value.
```{r}
curLocale = Sys.getlocale()
Sys.setlocale(locale = "fr_CA")
as.Date("janvier/9/2024", "%B/%d/%Y")
Sys.setlocale(locale = curLocale)
```
But on my machine, this gives a warning message
```
Warning message:
In Sys.setlocale(locale = curLocale) :
  OS reports request to set locale to "en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8" cannot be honored
```

Let's not set all categories in the locale, but just the LC_TIME category:
```{r}
curLocale = Sys.getlocale("LC_TIME")
Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME", locale = "fr_CA")
as.Date("janvier/9/2024", "%B/%d/%Y")
Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME", locale = curLocale)
```
We can check the locale is back to the original
```{r}
Sys.getlocale("LC_TIME") == curLocale
```


So now we can write a function to convert the date, allowing the caller
to specify the format and, optionally, a locale.
If the locale is provided, we arrange to set the locale to that value
and reset to the original locale when the function was called.
We do this with `on.exit()` to ensure it happens even if there is an error 
and the function does return in the usual succesful manner.

Our function is 
```{r}
cvtDate =
function(str, fmt = "%d-%b-%Y", locale = NA)
{
    if(length(locale) > 0 && !is.na(locale)) {
        prev = Sys.getlocale("LC_TIME")
        on.exit(Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME", locale = prev))
        Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME", locale = locale)
    }

    as.Date(str, fmt)
}
```

We can use this and don't have to set our locale ourselves.

Let's capture our current locale and then test the function
```{r}
orig = Sys.getlocale()
```

```{r}
cvtDate("16-Oct-1996")

cvtDate("5/Okt/2024", "%d/%b/%Y") # NA
cvtDate("5/Okt/2024", "%d/%b/%Y", "de_DE") # correct

cvtDate("janvier/9/2024", "%B/%d/%Y") # NA
cvtDate("janvier/9/2024", "%B/%d/%Y", "fr_CA")    
```

And we can check the locale is back to its original
```
Sys.getlocale() == orig
```



It is always good to know what locale you are using and share that with others when asking
questions, e.g., on Piazza.
It is good to report the output from `sessionInfo()`, e.g.,
