# Note

+  go() is just a shorthand function for sending SQL queries to the baseball database.
```{r}
go = function(qry) dbGetQuery(bb, qry)
```

+ Connection to database
```{r}
bb = dbConnect(SQLite(), "/Users/duncan/Downloads/lahman_1871-2022.sqlite")
```

# Question

+ **What team won the World Series in 2010? Include the name of the team, the league and division.**


+ Explore which tables we need and which columns from these.
+ Figure out how the result should be structured
    + 1 row
    + name of team
    + league
    + division
    + can include year and possibly the total number of games in the world series.

---

+ SeriesPost table is for the post season games
   + Includes World series and all conference and division series and
   + For all years

+ Look at the first few rows to get a sense of the values

```
go("SELECT * FROM SeriesPost LIMIT 10")
```

# 

+ Get the name of the tame from `Teams.name`
+ Also Teams.lgId and teams.divId


+ Need to connect the row(s) in SeriesPost to Teams table.

+ Not concerned with dropping rows where no match between two tables.
    + So can use an INNER JOIN
    + Or simple FROM with 2 tables.

#     
```
go("    
SELECT t.yearID, t.name, t.lgID, t.divID, s.teamIDwinner
FROM SeriesPost AS s, 
     Teams AS t

  AND s.round = 'WS'
  AND s.teamIDwinner = t.teamID

3    1960 San Francisco Giants   NL  &lt;NA&gt;          SFN
   ....
   ....    
```

+ Why multiple rows?    

---

+ How many rows in Teams have teamID = 'SFN'
```r
go("
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Teams
WHERE teamID = 'SFN'
")
```

+ 65

```
go("SELECT * FROM Teams WHERE teamID = 'SFN'")

+ There is a row per year.

# Refine Query

<pre>

# Question:  Add the name of the losing team, the league and division.

+ Consider a simpler question
  + **What team LOST the World Series in 2010? Include the name of the team, the league and division.**


+ Switch our previous query from winner to loser
<pre>
SELECT t.yearID, t.name, t.lgID, t.divID, s.teamIDloser
FROM SeriesPost AS s, 
     Teams AS t
WHERE s.yearID = 2010
  AND s.round = 'WS'
  AND s.<font color="red">teamIDloser</font> = t.teamID    
  AND t.yearID = 2010
</pre>

```
  yearID          name lgID divID teamIDloser
1   2010 Texas Rangers   AL     W         TEX
```

---
# Possible Solution

+ We could try to combine the results from the winner and the loser queries
   + How?

+ Can't use cbind() in SQL.


```
  yearID                 name lgID divID teamIDwinner
1   2010 San Francisco Giants   NL     W          SFN
```



---
# Better Approach

+ Join SeriesPost with Teams and Teams
   + First Teams for the winner information
   + Second Teams for the loser information

<pre>
SELECT t.yearID, t.name, t.lgID, t.divID, s.teamIDwinner,
<font color="red">       t2.name, t2.lgId, t2.divID, s.teamIDloser</font>
FROM SeriesPost AS s,
     Teams AS t,
<font color="red"> Teams AS t2</font>
WHERE s.yearID = 2010
  AND s.round = "WS"
  AND s.teamIDwinner = t.teamID    
  AND t.yearID = 2010
<font color="red">  AND s.teamIDloser = t2.teamID    
  AND t2.yearID = 2010</font>
<pre>

```
  yearID                 name lgID divID teamIDwinner          name lgID divID teamIDloser
1   2010 San Francisco Giants   NL     W          SFN Texas Rangers   AL     W         TEX
```


---
# New Question


+ Get this information for each year

```
yearID   name   lgID   divID   teamIDwinner   name   lgID   divID   teamIDloser   
```

+ Ideas?

---


+ Match the yearID in Teams and SeriesPosts
   + for both Teams tables.

```
SELECT t.yearID, t.name, t.lgID, t.divID, s.teamIDwinner,
       t2.name, t2.lgId, t2.divID, s.teamIDloser
FROM SeriesPost AS s,
     Teams AS t,
     Teams AS t2
WHERE s.round = "WS"
  AND s.teamIDwinner = t.teamID    
  AND t.yearID = s.yearId   --  replace 2010 with t.yearID = s.yearID
  AND s.teamIDloser = t2.teamID    
  AND t2.yearID = s.yearId;  -- replace 2010 with t2.yearId = s.yearID
```

---
# For 2016, compute the total payroll of each of the different teams. 


```
SELECT t.name, SUM(s.salary) AS payroll, s.yearID, t.teamID
FROM Salaries AS s,
     Teams AS t
WHERE s.yearID = 2016
  AND t.yearID = 2016
  AND t.teamID = s.teamID
GROUP BY s.teamID  
ORDER BY payroll DESC;
```


---
# Compute the total payroll of each of the different teams for each year. 

```
SELECT t.name, SUM(s.salary) AS payroll, s.yearID, t.teamID
FROM Salaries AS s,
     Teams AS t
WHERE  t.teamID = s.teamID
GROUP BY s.teamID, s.yearID;
```

+ Results seems wrong

---
# Next try

```
SELECT t.name, SUM(s.salary) AS payroll, s.yearID AS year, t.teamID
FROM Salaries AS s,
     Teams AS t
WHERE  t.teamID = s.teamID
  AND  t.yearID = s.yearID     
GROUP BY s.teamID, s.yearID
ORDER BY year, payroll DESC;
```


+ To Check
   + Compute the total for a given year and team

---
# New Question

+ **How many players are there in each year, from 2000 to 2022?**

+ Which table(s)?


---

```sql
SELECT yearID, COUNT(DISTINCT playerID) AS numPlayers 
FROM Appearances
WHERE yearID BETWEEN 2000 and 2022
GROUP BY yearID;
```



    <!--

SELECT t.name, SUM(s.salary) AS payroll, s.yearID, t.teamID
