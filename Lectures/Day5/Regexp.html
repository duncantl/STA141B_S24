# Regular Expressions

+ Pattern matching in text

+ Cleaning, Extracting and Transforming data

+ Find strings that contain a pattern
   + Which lines start with #
   + Which line(s) contain the sequence of characters "TIME"
   + which line(s) contains email, date(s), time, URL, Phone number, IP address, MAC address, ...
   + text in quotes  - 'He said "this is it" and then left'

+ Find the specific pattern in the string
   +  not just whether it contains pattern, but where in the strings the pattern occurs.

+ Replace/substitute pattern with another string/pattern

+ Extract matched pattern

# Usefulness of Regular Expressions

+ From `Mastering Regular Expressions` book:
```
Regular expressions can save you time and aggravation.
```
   + They can also be frustrating and aggravating.

```
A command of regular expressions is an invaluable skill. Yet what is power
in the hands of an expert can be fraught with peril for the unwary.  .....
```

```
Once you've mastered regular expressions, they'll become an invaluable part of your toolkit.
You will wonder how you ever got by without them.
```

---
# Regular Expressions

+ Another opinion
```
If regular expressions are the solution to your problem, you now have 2 problems!
```

+ But for data cleaning and transformation, they are "invaluable".
   + Short recipes for getting what we want.

+ swiss army knife 

+ rarely the best tool for a specific task
  + see if there is a specialized "parser" for your data, e.g., JSON, XML/HTML, YAML.
  + but a good tool for many jobs

# Core Regular Expression R Functions

+ Regular Expressions - Powerful Domain-specific Language (DSL) for expressing patterns.

+ Several functions  that take a regular expression as a string
  + pattern is written in regular expression *language*
  + functions interpret regular expression to create complex matching procedure.

+ R Functions

+ Identify which elements contain pattern
   + grep(), grepl(), gregexpr()

+ Substitute/Extract
   + sub(), gsub(), regmatches()

+ Other functions supporting regular expressions
  + strsplit()
  + list.files(pattern = )
  + agrep(), adist() - fuzzy matching, distance

---
# grep(), grepl(), gregexpr()

+ `grep("regex.pattern", characterVector)`
   + returns all indices in characterVector in which the pattern was found

+ `grepl("regex.pattern", characterVector)`
   + returns a logical vector with the same length as characterVector
   + TRUE if that element contains the pattern, FALSE otherwise.

+ `gregexpr("regex.pattern", characterVector)`
   + result for elements of characterVector
   + gives the positions of all matches of the pattern in each of the elements of characterVector.

```
str = c("The central dogma of dog owners",
        "She doggishly worked to identify the endogenous variables")
m = gregexpr("dog", str)
regmatches(str, m)
```
---
+ gsub(), sub()

```r
ans = gsub("pattern", "replace", charVector)
```
    + replaces each match of `pattern` with the content of `replace`
    + `replace` can refer to content matched in `pattern`

+ gsub() - global substitution - all matches within each string
```r
gsub("dog", "cat", "The dogma of dog owners")
[1] "The catma of cat owners"
```

+ sub() - first match within each string
```r
sub("dog", "cat", "The dogma of dog owners")
[1] "The catma of dog owners"
```

# Regular Expression Language
## Core elements

+ literal matching
+ wildcard
+ start and end - meta characters - ^ and $
   + escaping meta-characters  (\\)
+ character classes
   + named character classes  ( [[:space:][:punct:]]
   + complement set   ([^])
+ quantifiers - ?, *, +, {m,n}
+ alternates (|)
+ grouping  ()
+ back references  (\\1)


---
# Regular Expression Language
## Core elements

+ Literal patterns  - "dog", "JAN"

+ Wildcard - matches any single character
   + `.`

+ Quantifiers
   + `?` - zero or one occurrence
   + `*` - zero or more occurences
   + `+` - 1 or more occurrences
   + `{n}` - exactly n occurrences
   + `{n,}` - n or more occurrences   
   + `{,n}` - zero up to  n occurrences
   + `{m,n}` - between m and n occurrences, inclusive

---
# Anchors

+ Beginning of string  - `^`

+ End of string - `$`

+ Start of word - `\b`

---
# Alternation via Character Sets

+ Often want to match
   + any number
   + any lower-case letter
   + any upper-case letter
   + any punctuation character

+ Use character sets - list inside `[ ]`
  +  Match A or X or Z
```
[AXZ]
(A|X|Z)
```


---
# Character Set Ranges

+ `[0123456789]` long to type.
+ Can use - to get ranges
```
  [0-9]
  [a-fA-F]
  [A-Za-z]
```

---
# Named Character Sets

+ Include `[:name:]` within containing/outside [] pair.
```
[abc[:space:][:punct:]]
```

+ Alphabetic characters `[:alpha:]`
+ lower case `[:lower:]`
+ upper case `[:upper:]`
+ Numbers `[:digit:]`
+ Punctuation `[:punct:]`
+ White space - `[:space:[`

+ [Named Character Sets](https://www.regular-expressions.info/posixbrackets.html)

---
# Opposite Set Ranges

+ Want everything but/except the elements in this set of characters.

+ Can put ^ at start of character set,  e.g.,  `[^a-f]`



---
# More complex Alternation  - OR

+ pattern1 OR pattern2 -  `dog|cat`

+ group the patterns via `()`

+ Start of string is From or To followed by : followed by space
```
"^(From|To): "
``` 


---
# Escaping Special/Meta Characters

+ How do we match a literal `$` or `.`
 + will be treated as special character.

+ Need to *escape*  - treat as literal.
  + Preceed by \\
```
grepl("\\.", c("123", "123.45"))
[1] FALSE  TRUE
```

+ Find $
```
grepl("\\$", c("$123K", "less than $2.45", "less than 2.45"))
[1] FALSE  TRUE
```
---
# Extract via gregexpr()/regmatch()  

```
m = gregexpr("[0-9]{1,2}-[A-Z]{3}-(19|20)[0-9]{2}", x)
regmatches(x, m)
```

+ gregexec() can help get the sub-patterns in a convenient form.

---
# Groups

+ Sometimes want to transform string to combination of pat1, pat2, pat3, ...
  + i.e. combine pat1, pat2, pat3, ... into a new string.

+ Put each pattern within () in regular expression.
  + refer to it in replacement by group number - `\\1`, `\\2`, `\\3`, ...


---
# Greedy Matching

+ Each pattern matches as much as it can
+ Next pattern picks up from where previous one finished.

+ Consider

```r
x = "            TIME     : 16-JAN-1995 00:00"
grepl("[0-9]{1,2}-[A-Z]{3}-(19|20)[0-9]{2}", x)
```

+ Want to match and extract the "16-JAN-1995"
```r
gsub(".*([0-9]{1,2}-[A-Z]{3}-(19|20)[0-9]{2}).*", "\\1", x)
```

+ But consider
```r
gsub(".*:", "", x)
```
    + Matches up to the : in 00:00 at the end of the string.

# Regular Expressions

+ Powerful Domain-specific Language (DSL) for expressing patterns in text.

+ Range from matching
   + literal sequence of characters
   + complex alternative patterns with different number

+ Succinct regular expression pattern as a string is a **program** to process each line
   + So has to be correct
   + Challenging to debug
