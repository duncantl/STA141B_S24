# Reading a "simple" tabular data file

Data on individual contributions to candidates, super PACs, etc. for
federal elections available from the FEC.

https://www.fec.gov/data/browse-data/?tab=bulk-data


Downloaded the file indiv22.zip file and
then extracted the itcont.txt.


This is itcont.txt from indiv22.zip.
I've named this itcont22.txt.
This has 62,260,592 lines/observations.

I've also created a smaller version for the git repository named itcont22_small.txt.
This contains the first 16,000 rows from itcont22.txt.


What format do the contents of the file have?

Full file is "too" big to open in a text editor.

Use shell command to look at the top.
```
head itcont22.txt
```

Or in R
```
readLines("itcont22.txt", n = 10)
```

```

+ no column names


```

```
```
Error in scan(file = file, what = what, sep = sep, quote = quote, dec = dec,  : 
  line 127 did not have 21 elements
```

Let's explore
```
ll = readLines(f, n = 128)  
ll[127]
```
```
[1] "C00740597|N|Q3|P|202210159533294077|15|IND|GEORGE, RACHEL|ATLANTA|GA|303274646|THE AARON'S COMPANY, INC.|ATTORNEY|09162022|500||7735726|1641974|||4102720221592492379"
```

Let's break this line into its separate elements.

```
els = strsplit(ll[127], "|")[[1]]
length(els)
```
What ????

```
els = strsplit(ll[127], "|", fixed = TRUE)[[1]]
length(els)
```

So it does have 21 elements.

What should we do next?

-------------

Let's see if it really is line 127.
Let's read up to 126 and see if that works.



```
d = read.table(f, sep = "|", header = FALSE, nrow = 126)
dim(d)
```

Summarize the results  as a quick sanity check:
```
summary(d)
sapply(d, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

That works.
So this does appear to be line 127.

We could also read the lines, exclude line 127 and  pass these to read.table
We'll read just past 127 just to check what happens:

```
ll = readLines(f, n = 130)[-127]
d = read.table(textConnection(ll), sep = "|", header = FALSE)
dim(d)
```
That works too.
We get 129 rows.

---

What if we got 135? 250? 1000? ...


---

So what is it about line 127 ?
+ The empty cells?
+ sequence of consecutive empty cells

Helps to look at other lines
```r
ll[125:129]
```

These have empty cells and consecutive empty cells.
We can see this by visually inspecting the text.

If we wanted to compute which lines had consecutive empty cells, e.g., for all the lines in the
file, we could use
```
tmp = strsplit(ll[125:129], "|", fixed = TRUE)
tmp2 = lapply(tmp, function(x) rle(x == ""))
sapply(tmp2, function(x)  sum( x$lengths[x$values] > 1))
```

---
What characters are in line 127 that we have not seen in the previous lines?

ll = readLines(f, n = 130)
ch = strsplit(ll[1:127], "")
a = unique(unlist(ch[1:126]))
setdiff( ch[[127]], a)


--------------

The issue is the ' in the "THE AARON'S COMPANY, INC."
This is the start of a string.  read.table() is looking for the end of that across multiple lines.

Where does it end?
Let's read 10,000 lines of the file and look for a ' past line 127.

ll = readLines(f, n = 10000)
i = grep("'", ll)

The first ' occurs on 127.
The second is on line 227.

els = strsplit(ll[i[1:2]], "|", fixed = TRUE)

On line 127, the ' occurs in column 12 - AARON's
On line 227, the ' occurs in column 13 - ARBY'S

So read.table is reading the value in column 12 on line 127 and finds
the end of the string in what we consider the 13th column on line 227.
When it finds the ' on line 227, it is still reading the 12th cell on line 127 and
won't end until it finds the next occurrence of the `|` character.
That occurs immediately after the ARBY'S.

That leaves columns 14 through 21 on line 227 to complete the remaining
cells for line 127 and that gives 20 entries.

This is a "coincidence".  We are getting an error, but otherwise
would get the wrong result.

---

Let's see what happens if we use fill = TRUE to complete lines
that don't have the full set of cells.

```
d = read.table(f, sep = "|", nrow = 127, header = FALSE, fill = TRUE)

d[127, ]
```

This shows an NA in the last/21st cell.  
The 20th value is "4011420231698210863" which is the 21st cell of line 227.

And the 12th value is 19205 characters containing many | characters.
```
nchar(d[127, 12])
```
This the contents of the remainder of line 127 up to the 13th cell in line 227.

So we get 127 rows because we asked for 127 and there were at least 127 rows.
But the call to read.table() actually consumed 227 lines of the file.
And we know that each line in the file should be a row in the data.frame.
So this is wrong.


If the ' had occurred in the 13th column of line 127, there would not have been
an error as consuming all the lines between 127 and 227 would have given  a single record
with 21 elements. So we have to be careful even when there is no error.

What are the arguments/parameters we can specify to read.table()?

See the help file or 

names(formals(read.table))
 [1] "file"             "header"           "sep"

[22] "stringsAsFactors" "fileEncoding"     "encoding"        
[25] "text"             "skipNul"         


The default value of quote is "\\"'".
```
formals(read.table)$quote
```
(Note the "\"'" when R prints this and the two \\ in my version.)

Let's set the value for the quote argument to '"' or the empty string.

```
d = read.table(f, sep = "|", nrow = 227, header = FALSE,  quote = '')
d[127,]
d[227,]
```

We should check other values.


--------------------------

So now we can read the whole file.

```
d = read.table(f, sep = "|", header = FALSE,  quote = '')
```
```
Error in scan(file = file, what = what, sep = sep, quote = quote, dec = dec,  : 
  line 15580 did not have 21 elements
```

```
ll = readLines(f, n = 15582)
ll[15580]
```

What's the problem with this line


Again, use fill = TRUE and look at the result

d = read.table(f, sep = "|", header = FALSE,  quote = '', nrows = 15581, fill = TRUE)

or

d2 = read.table(f, sep = "|", header = FALSE,  quote = '', nrows = 2, skip = 15579, fill = TRUE)

26 minutes.
9.33 minutes with read.table::fread() and it automatically corrected quoting.
Converting it to a data.frame() with the regular semantics takes 4 seconds.

Each package/function makes its own assumptions and has its own limitations.
fread() works well here.
It can't handle connections which we will need in another case study.


<!-- (Is this because the connection API is not public?) -->

Remember we can still get the wrong result even if there are no errors or warnings.

Can't prepend 0 to all values if starts with 10, 11, 12.

All values have 7 characters. Are there any with 8?

+ Does the day of the month always have 2 digits, even if 1 to 9?


10, 11 and 12 may be near the end??


Let's sample

tmp = as.character(sample(d$TRANSACTION_DT, 100000))

w = nchar(tmp) == 7
tmp[w] = paste0(0, tmp[w])


z  = as.Date(tmp, "%m%d%Y")
table(is.na(z))

range(z)


plot(density(z))

plot(density(as.numeric(z)))


abline(v = as.numeric(as.Date("2020/1/1", "2021/1/1", "2022/1/1")), col = "red")

Nothing appears

abline(v = as.numeric(as.Date("2020/1/1", "2021/1/1", "2022/1/1", "%Y/%d/%m")), col = "red")

Again, nothing appears


Check the values

as.numeric(as.Date("2020/1/1", "2021/1/1", "2022/1/1", "%Y/%d/%m"))

NA

Something wrong


as.numeric(as.Date(c("2020/1/1", "2021/1/1", "2022/1/1"), "%Y/%d/%m"))

Now we can omit the format string


as.numeric(as.Date(c("2020/1/1", "2021/1/1", "2022/1/1")))


Now draw the lines


abline(v = as.numeric(as.Date(c("2020/1/1", "2021/1/1", "2022/1/1"))), col = "red")

rug(z)


------


TRANSACTION_PGI

format is TypeYEAR

Type is a single character


set.seed(123456)

d3 = d[sample(nrow(d), 100000), ]
