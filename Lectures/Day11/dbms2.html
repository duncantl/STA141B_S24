# Relational Databases - 2


### Duncan Temple Lang

<div style="clear: both"/>

<!-- <hr width="50%"/> -->

# Previously.....

+ Motivation for relational databases
+ sqlite3 command line in shell/terminal
+ DBI and RSQLite packages in R
+ dbConnect()
+ `SELECT  variables FROM table`
+ dbGetQuery()



---
# dbListTables() & dbListFields()

+ Names of the tables in the database
```
dbListTables(db)
```

+ Names of the fields in a table
```
dbListFields(db, "moz_cookies")
```
  + name of table


+ List fields of all tables
```
lapply(dbListTables(db), function(tbl) dbListFields(db, tbl))
```


---
# SELECT Query - number of rows


+ R Command dbGetQuery()
```
dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM moz_cookies")
```

+ 1st Argument - Connection to the database
  + Created one time
```
db = dbConnect(SQLite(), "/path/to/sqlite/database/file")
```

+ 2nd Argument is SQL command as a string
  + Analogous to regular expression in `grep(rx, str)`
     + interpreted by regular expression engine.
     + not interpreted by R


---
# Single Table versus Two or more tables

+ Today we'll start with one table and build up the elements of SQL

+ Then move  to 2+ tables.


---
# Subsetting

+  WHERE
```sql
SELECT * FROM moz_cookies WHERE expiry > 1632529635
```

+ equality operator `=`
```sql
SELECT * FROM moz_cookies WHERE host = 'www.nytimes.com'
```

+ Also `<`, `<=`, `>=`, etc.

+ Also !=, but can also use NOT
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM moz_cookies WHERE host != 'www.nytimes.com' 
```

+ But there is a more general NOT operator
```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM moz_cookies WHERE NOT host = 'www.nytimes.com' 
```

---
# Other Predicate Tests

+ `BETWEEN val1 AND  val2`
```sql
SELECT * FROM moz_cookies
    WHERE expiry BETWEEN 1000000 AND 2000000
```

+ ` IN (val, val, ...)`
```sql
SELECT * FROM moz_cookies
   WHERE host IN ('www.nytimes.com', 'www.washingtonpost.com')
```

+ IS NULL
   + for detecting values that are NULL or empty.

+ `WHERE host LIKE '%.org'`

---
# Simple Pattern Matching - LIKE

+  `LIKE 'pattern'`

+ Different from regular expressions

  + Some DBMS provide regular expression functions.

    + built-in or via extensions

+  _ - matches any character

+  % - matches 0 or more (any) characters 

+ e.g. host values that end with .org
```sql
SELECT host FROM moz_cookies
            WHERE  host LIKE '%.org'
```

+ e.g. host name that starts with `www.`, ends with `.com` and has three characters in between
```sql
SELECT host FROM moz_cookies
            WHERE  host LIKE 'www.___.com'
```


---
# NOT

+ With these operators beyond =, we need NOT as more general version than !=

```sql
WHERE NOT expiry BETWEEN 1000000 AND 2000000

WHERE NOT host IN ('www.nytimes.com', 'www.washingtonpost.com')

WHERE NOT host LIKE ('%.org')
```


---
# Combining Conditions

+ Combine logical tests/predicates
  + AND, OR
```sql
SELECT *
FROM moz_cookies
WHERE  host = 'www.nytimes.com'
	OR
      host = 'www.washingtonpost.com'
```

---
# Naming Columns in the Result - `AS`

+ Sometimes names of columns are inconvenient
```sql
a = dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT host, COUNT(*) FROM moz_cookies GROUP BY host")
names(a)
```
  + second column's name is `"COUNT(*)"`


+ Use AS keyword in query to map name to column in results

  + Only in the results, not in the original table(s) in the DBMS.

```sql
SELECT  var  AS name
FROM table;
```
```sql
SELECT  COUNT(*) AS num
FROM table;
```

<!--
```
a = dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT host, COUNT(*) AS num FROM moz_cookies GROUP BY host")
names(a)
```
-->

---
# Operations on Columns

+ Can transform  variables with functions and arithmetic
```sql
SELECT age / 10, log (weight), weight/height, substr(IPAddress, 1, 3)
  FROM table;
```
+ NOTE:  SQLite has very few built-in math functions

+ These work tuple by tuple and return a value for each tuple

  + Scalar functions

  + Different from aggregate functions such as COUNT(), MIN(), MAX(), AVG()

    + operate one tuple at a time but only return a single result, not per tuple.

---
# Operations on Columns (ctd.)

+ Use AS to rename these columns, as desired

+ Can also use the new variable name  in the WHERE clause
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT host, length(host) AS Len
FROM moz_cookies
WHERE Len > 10
```

+ `COUNT (DISTINCT var)`
```r
 dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT COUNT(name) AS Num FROM moz_cookies ")
 dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT host) AS Num FROM moz_cookies ")
```
---
# Subset based on value computed from table

+ Suppose we want to get the rows that have a value of expiry greater than the log of the mean of expiry

+ In R
```r
df[ df$expiry > mean(log(df$expiry)), ]
```
or
```
expiry.mean = mean(log(df$expiry))
df[ df$expiry > expiry.mean, ]
```

+ Tempting to do in SQL similarly as

```
dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM moz_cookies WHERE log(expiry) > AVG(log(expiry))")
```

+ Doesn't work - get an error message.
```
Parse error: misuse of aggregate function AVG()
  SELECT * FROM moz_cookies WHERE log(expiry) > AVG(log(expiry));
                                  error here ---^
```

---
# Nested Queries

+  Instead
```
SELECT * FROM moz_cookies
  WHERE log(expiry) > (SELECT AVG(log(expiry)) from moz_cookies)
```

+ Another approach is 2 queries from R

   + Get the mean

   + Insert that value into a second query

```{r}
expiry.mean = dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT AVG(log(expiry)) FROM moz_cookies")[1, 1]
qry = sprintf("SELECT * FROM moz_cookies WHERE log(expiry) > %lf", expiry.mean)
ans = dbGetQuery(con, qry)
```

---
# Grouping 

+ Want to operate separately on groups of rows grouped by one or more variables

+ Like tapply(), by(), aggregate() in R

+ Different from getting the rows from the DBMS arranged by this grouping variable
   + Then just use ORDER BY to arrange the rows

+ But separate the rows into groups/buckets and then process aggregate for each group

+ `GROUP BY`
```sql
SELECT COUNT(host)
FROM moz_cookies
GROUP BY host;
```

+  Almost always also want the group label/value in the result
```
dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT host, COUNT( host) AS Num
                 FROM moz_cookies
                 GROUP BY host")
```

---
# `ORDER BY`

+ And often want to order the results
  + could do it in R, but also in DBMS

```sql
SELECT host, COUNT( host) AS Num
FROM moz_cookies
GROUP BY host
ORDER BY Num;
```

+ Control order
```sql
SELECT host, COUNT( host) AS Num
FROM moz_cookies
GROUP BY host
ORDER BY Num DESC;
```
---
# Subsetting the Groups

+ Can limit to a subset of the grouping values

+ Can subset/post-process the results in R.

+ In SQL, can use nested SELECT
```sql
SELECT host, COUNT(*)
   FROM
      (SELECT * FROM moz_cookies
                WHERE
                   host IN ('www.nytimes.com',
                            'www.washingtonpost.com',
                            '.wikipedia.org'))
   GROUP BY host
```

or
```sql
SELECT host, COUNT(*)
FROM moz_cookies
WHERE host IN ('www.nytimes.com',
               'www.washingtonpost.com',
               '.wikipedia.org'))
GROUP BY host
```
---
# HAVING

+ Can't always subset the original table with WHERE, but instead need to
  subset the **result** of the GROUP BY

+ Subset the results based on a dynamic/data-based value
  + e.g. groups where the count > 10 or average count

```sql
# WRONG 
SELECT host, COUNT(*) As Num
FROM moz_cookies
GROUP BY host
WHERE Num > 10
```
  + Syntax error

+ WHERE only applies to the rows created via the SELECT-FROM

+ Instead, use HAVING for subsetting the results of GROUP BY

```sql
SELECT host, COUNT(*) As Num
FROM moz_cookies
GROUP BY host
HAVING Num > 10
```

---
# HAVING clause

+ Often use HAVING on COUNT() which has aggregated the records in a sub-group to a single tuple

+ However, HAVING works row by row within each sub-group
  + COUNT() is a special case where only one tuple in each sub-group.

+ See havingEg.sql


---
# Test Database

+ Create database with a table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Foo (
 g INTEGER,
 age  INTEGER
);
```

+ Populate with sample values
```sql
INSERT INTO Foo VALUES
(1, 20),
(1, 30),
(1, 10),
(2, 55),
(2, 27);
```

+ Test query
```sql
select * FROM Foo
GROUP BY g
HAVING age = MIN(age);
1|10
2|27
```



---
# Working in Chunks

+ Query that generates large amount of data

   + Don't want to have it all in R at the same time

+ Or want to process each group and do something with related other data

+ Or want to work asynchronously

   + Have database work on query while we continue do something else (in R session) as we wait

   + Check back with the database to 

+ `rs = dbSendQuery(db, sql)`

   + Send query and immediately return to R

   + don't wait for the result

---
# Working with Chunks (ctd.)

+ Returned object from `dbSendQuery()` is a `result set`

   + Can query it to see if there are rows available

   + read `n` of those rows.


+ `df = dbFetch(rs, n)`

+ Repeat and consume rows in blocks



---
# VIEW

+ Ordinarily, the result set disappears after query.

+ Sometimes we want to operate on the result set with several subsequent queries on that temporary result set.

+ Use a VIEW - virtual table that wasn't in defined in the original DBMS

   + Will disappear when we disconnect from the DBMS

```sql
CREATE VIEW OrgCookies
 AS SELECT * FROM moz_cookies WHERE host LIKE '%.org';

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM OrgCookies;
```

+  Can explicitly discard view with `DROP VIEW`

```sql
DROP VIEW OrgCookies
```

---
# Assignment

+ If performing the SQL queries in R, I suggest the following approach for your report

```
qry = "
SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE var = condition;
"

dbGetQuery(db, qry)
```

+ Separate the query from the dbGetQuery
+ Format for maximum readability
   + for you and grader.

+ Also use sqlite3 to get additional information about errors
   + e.g., syntax errors.

---
# Assignment

+ Provide the question number and the text of the question

+ Then your solution.

+ And the results that demonstrate the results are what we expect.

# Relational Databases
## Multiple Tables and JOIN

+ *Thanks to Nick Ulle and Clark Fitzgerald for examples.*

+ Simple example

+ 3 tables

+ Company name, stock ticker string, income and SIC code(?)

  + `fang_info`
```
	      ticker   company_name sic_code  net_income
1   AMZN AMAZON COM INC     5961  2371000000
2 GOOGLE  ALPHABET INC.     7370 19478000000
3     FB   FACEBOOK INC     7370 10188000000
4   NFLX    NETFLIX INC     7841   186678000
```

---

+ SIC code is a Standard Industrial Classification for an industry

+ Table of SIC codes and descriptions

   + fang_sic

```
   SIC                            Description
1 3292                       Abestos Products
2 5182 Wine and Distilled Alcoholic Beverages
3 5961          Catalog and Mail-Order Houses

+ Same result as

```sql
SELECT *
FROM fang_info AS i,
     fang_prices AS p
WHERE i.ticker = p.ticker;
```

# Note

+ 
```sql
SELECT * FROM fang_info AS i
   INNER JOIN fang_prices AS p
           ON i.ticker = p.ticker;
```
+ Note the use of AS for the table names

+ The need to differentiate the two ticker columns

+ The result contains two columns named ticker
```
    ticker   company_name sic_code  net_income ticker       date    high
```

+ Can select which columns to keep
  + also use `AS` to rename one or both of them

```sql    
SELECT i.*, p.date, p.high AS "Daily Maximum"
FROM fang_info AS i
INNER JOIN fang_prices AS p
ON i.ticker = p.ticker;
```

# Order of Evaluation of SQL Query

+ Understanding how the different elements of a query are evaluated helps to reason and debug

+ Consider the stackexchange data

```sql
SELECT  PostTypeId, value, COUNT(PostTypeId) 
 FROM Posts AS p, PostTypeIdMap AS m  
 WHERE PostTypeId = m.Id 
   AND value IN ('Question', 'Answer')
 GROUP BY PostTypeId 
```



---
# Evaluation Order


+ FROM or JOIN 

+ WHERE - selects the rows to be operated on.
   + executed before both the aggregate functions and the SELECT statement.

+ GROUP BY
   + any grouping levels eliminated by the WHERE will not appear as groups.

+ HAVING evaluated after the aggregation functions

+ SELECT - creates a new table with columns specified and the rows produced by the clauses before

+ DISTINCT - after SELECT has created a new table

+ ORDER BY 

+ LIMIT 

---
# What about Nested Queries?

+ They are evaluated according to the same order as above.

+ Whatever step in which the nested query occurs.



---
# Reasoning about JOINs

+ Two tables <!-- - A and B -->
+ Compatible columns allowing us to link/join rows

```sql
select *
FROM fang_info;
```

# LEFT JOIN

   + THEN
+ Append the rows/tuples that had no match with the second/right table
  + rows from left/first table
  + NULL values for all the columns  from second/right table.

# Cumulative Sum

+ How to compute the cumulative sum in SQL?
  + across rows/tuples,
  + but not a single answer

+ Let's make a simple table for exploring

```sql
CREATE TABLE A (
  year INTEGER,
  val INTEGER
);
INSERT INTO A VALUES
(2004, 2), (2003, 12), (2002, 3), (2005, 5);

2004|2
2003|12
2002|3
2005|5
```
---
# Cumulative Sum

+ Want to compute  cumulative sum across years of val, to get

```
year a  cumulativeSum
2002|3 |3
2003|12|15
2004|2 |17
2005|5 |22
```

---
# Window functions and the OVER operator

+ aggregate functions (e.g. SUM, MIN, AVG) compute over all tuples in a group or entire table.
  + typically reduce to one result

+ Window functions work on one or more  rows,
   + but returns a value for each tuple.

```sql
SELECT year, val, SUM(val)
OVER (ORDER BY year DESC)
FROM A;
```

+ Order the result (not the window function) by year

```sql
SELECT year, val, SUM(val)
OVER (ORDER BY year DESC)
FROM A
ORDER BY year;
```

+   Or can "name" the window, creating it later in the query

```sql
SELECT a, SUM(a) OVER win
FROM A
WINDOW win AS (ORDER BY a DESC);
```


---
# Compute differences between values

+ Differences between years
   + e.g. 2003's value - 2002's value,
   + 2005's value - 2004's value

+ Let's add a new year
```sql
INSERT INTO A VALUES (2010, 32);
```

+ Want to get
```
2002|
2003|1
2004|1
2005|1
2010|5
```

---
# Refer to previous row

+ lag() function

```sql
select year,  year - lag(year) OVER win
FROM A
WINDOW win AS (ORDER BY year);
```
